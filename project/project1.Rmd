## My Project 

My project will use data from quadrat surveys of plant cover on Mt St. Helens from 1995 to 2009. I will join a dataset with quadrat cover information (richness, diversity, etc) with a dataset containing plot descriptors (coordinates, succession type, etc), joined by Plot ID.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading in the data

```{r}
structure <- read.csv("MSH_STRUCTURE_PLOT_YEAR.csv")
descriptors <- read.csv("MSH_PLOT_DESCRIPTORS.csv")

```

## Fixing and Tidying

```{R}
structure %>% unite("PLOT_CODE", 2:3) -> structure_final
descriptors_final <- descriptors %>% separate(PLOT_CODE,into = c("PLOT_NAME","PLOT_NUM
BER"), sep=4, convert=T) %>% structure %>% unite("PLOT_CODE", 2:3) %>% 
  separate(IMPACT_TYPE,into = c("IMPACT_TYPE_1","IMPACT_TYPE_2","IMPACT_TYPE_3"), sep=";", convert=T)
structure_final <- structure_final %>% group_by(PLOT_CODE) %>% slice(1)
structure_final %>% subset(PLOT_CODE!="BUCC_4") -> structure_final
descriptors_final %>% subset(PLOT_CODE!="PUPL_10") -> descriptors_final
descriptors_final %>% subset(PLOT_CODE!="PUPL_11") -> descriptors_final
descriptors_final %>% subset(PLOT_CODE!="PUPL_12") -> descriptors_final
descriptors_final[30, "PLOT_CODE"] <- "LAHR_4"
descriptors_final[31, "PLOT_CODE"] <- "LAHR_5"
descriptors_final[32, "PLOT_CODE"] <- "LAHR_6"
descriptors_final[33, "PLOT_CODE"] <- "LAHR_7"
descriptors_final[34, "PLOT_CODE"] <- "LAHR_8"

```

## Joining
I performed a full join on the two datasets, because there weren’t too many columns/variables and Iwanted to preserve all of them. There are 24 variables in total, including the PLOT_CODE variable theyare joined on. I removed all rows except for the first year of observation in the plot structure dataset,
because I wanted the number of rows to match up to the plot descriptors dataset and I wasn’t necessarily interested in looking at data scross years (as the descriptors dataset didn’t include measurements by year). There were 92 observations in the descriptors data, and 1743 observations in the structure data; 1654 were dropped from structure and 3 were dropped from descriptors to make an equal 89 observations in the joined dataset.

```{r}
full_join(descriptors_final,structure_final,by="PLOT_CODE") -> plots_joined
plots_joined %>% glimpse()

```

## Summary Stats
I found the mean, sd, var, min, max, and number of distinct numeric values across my data. I also explored a few pther variables of interest to me; ike the number of distinct entries for succession type, as well as the evenness and richness by plot ID when richness was greater than the mean. I created a
joined table of these summary stats. I created a new variable for time span to easily see how long a plot had been observed.
```{R}

plots_joined %>% 
  select(YEAR,RICHNESS,COVER_PERCENT,FREQUENCY,HPRIME,EVENNESS) %>% arrange(YEAR) %>% glimpse()

plots_joined %>% mutate(TIME_SPAN=LAST_YEAR-FIRST_YEAR) -> plots_joined
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, mean, na.rm=T) %>% pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Mean") -> dat_means
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sd, na.rm=T)%>% pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "St. Dev.") -> dat_sds
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, var, na.rm=T)%>% pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Variance") -> dat_var
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, min, na.rm=T)%>% pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Min") -> dat_min
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, max, na.rm=T)%>% pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Max") -> dat_max
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, n_distinct, na.rm=T)%>% 
  pivot_longer(1:9, names_to = "Variable", values_to = 
  "N_Distinct") -> dat_dist
full_join(dat_means,dat_sds,dat_var,by="Variable") -> joined_stats
full_join(joined_stats,dat_var,by="Variable") -> joined_stats2
full_join(joined_stats2,dat_min,by="Variable") -> joined_stats3
full_join(joined_stats3,dat_max,by="Variable") -> joined_stats4
full_join(joined_stats4,dat_dist,by="Variable") -> joined_stats5
joined_stats5

plots_joined %>% summarize(n=n_distinct(SUCCESSION_TYPE)) %>% glimpse()
plots_joined %>% select("PLOT_CODE","SUCCESSION_TYPE","RICHNESS","EVENNESS") %>% 
  group_by(PLOT_CODE) %>% filter(RICHNESS>7.0898876)
plots_joined %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, sd, na.rm=T) %>% arrange()
plots_joined %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, var, na.rm=T) %>% arrange()
plots_joined %>% group_by(YEAR) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, n_distinct, na.rm=T) %>% arrange()

plots_joined %>% group_by(PLOT_CODE) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, mean, na.rm=T)
plots_joined %>% group_by(PLOT_CODE) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, min, na.rm=T)
plots_joined %>% group_by(PLOT_CODE) %>% summarize_if(is.numeric, max, na.rm=T)

```

## Visualizing
I created a heatmap of my numeric data to see which variables correlated the most. Species richness,evenness, and Shannon diversity index (H prime) correlated highly, which makes sense because they are all measures of diversity. The bar chart shows that by far, percent cover of vegetation is preserved the most by tephra and weak blast impact types, while percent cover is at a similar low range for other impact types. The boxplot compares species richness across different levels of succession. It was very interesting to see that disturbance habitat showed a much higher average species richness than primary and secondary succession habitats.
```{R}
plots_joined %>% select(9:13,20:24) %>% select_if(is.numeric)%>%cor%>%as.data.frame%>%
rownames_to_column%>%pivot_longer(-1)%>%
ggplot(aes(rowname,name,fill=value))+geom_tile()+
geom_text(aes(label=round(value,2)))+
xlab("")+ylab("")+coord_fixed()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1
))+labs(title = "Correlation Matrix")

plots_joined %>% ggplot(aes(IMPACT_TYPE_1,COVER_PERCENT,color=IMPACT_TYPE_1)) +
 geom_bar(stat="summary", fun=mean) +
 labs(title = "Percent Cover by Impact Type", x="IMPACT TYPE", y="PERCENT COVER", color="IMPACT TYPE")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1))

plots_joined %>%
 ggplot(aes(SUCCESSION_TYPE,RICHNESS,
            color=SUCCESSION_TYPE))+geom_boxplot()+ 
            labs(title = "Species Richness by Succession Type", x="Succession Type", color="Succession Type")
```

## PAM clustering

```{R}
library(cluster)
pam_dat <- plots_joined %>% select(RICHNESS,COVER_PERCENT,HPRIME,EVENNESS,HEAT_LOAD)
sil_width <- vector()
for (i in 2:10) {
 pam_fit <- pam(pam_dat, k = i)
 sil_width[i] <- pam_fit$silinfo$avg.width
}
ggplot()+ geom_line(aes(x=1:10,y=sil_width))+scale_x_continuous(name="k",breaks = 1:10
)

pam_final <-plots_joined %>% select(RICHNESS,COVER_PERCENT,HPRIME,EVENNESS,HEAT_LOAD)%>% scale %>% as.data.frame
pam <- pam_final %>% pam(2)
pam_final <- pam_final %>% mutate(cluster=as.factor(pam$clustering))
```

## Visualizing Pairwise Relationships
Once again we can see that the most closely correlated variables are Shannon’s diversity index (H
prime) and richness. Little else has as strong a correlation, although notably we can see that percent
cover correlates somewhat with richness.
```{R}
library(plotly)
library(GGally)
ggpairs(pam_final, aes(color=cluster))
```

## Interpeting Average Silhouette Width 
The structure found here is weak, with an average silhouette length of 0.44.
```{R}
plot(pam,which=2)
```

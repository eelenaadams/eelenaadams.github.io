Hello, it's me: Elena!

I am a third year biology student at UT Austin studying ecology, evolution, and animal behavior, with a certificate in applied statistical modeling. I am interested in nearly every aspect of biology, but my true passion is for ecology, specifically urban ecology.

I am a researcher, a homebody, a plant collector, and an aspiring farm animal sanctuary owner (ok maybe not but one can dream, right?)

My current research is focused on behavior in Poeciliid fishes; specifically, Xiphophorous nigrensis, the northern swordtail. I am currently working on a project to determine cognitive and behavioral differences arising in females raised in different social environments. Animal minds are so cool! 

This is my website, please see my resume and projects if you'd like!
